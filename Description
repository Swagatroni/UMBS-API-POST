Description:
  This program is written in Python and gathers data from a google sheet, sorts the data into usable variables then creates GET and POST requests
  to and from the provided APIs. Before the program is ready to run with an alternate google sheet you will need to authorize 
  API usage on the sheet then create a credentials.json file that the program will inherit from. If the columns of the provided
  data change there are variables that store the relative index of the column and can be easily changed. The google sheet will 
  throw an error if there are to many request within a 100 second period but can be easily remidied with a sleep timer.

Tips:
  In the program, there are 9 lines at the top that dictate what information is in which column and are assigned to variables for an easy way to change the import column.
  To use this program you will have to change the credentials name and the name of the google sheet. 
  There are commented-out lines in the handleExtension and handlePayment functions that activate the link to send the confirmation text.
  There are also a few print statements to see what functions are being called and how they are operating, but can be commented out/deleted if need be.
  There is also a block comment at the bottom that adds a single request to the queue for testing purposes.
  There is also an error if you attempt to proccess to many request within a certain time, but should be easily fixed with a sleep timer.
